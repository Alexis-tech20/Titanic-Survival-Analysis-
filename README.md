# Titanic Survival Analysis

This project explores the factors that influenced passenger survival during the Titanic disaster. Using data analysis, logistic regression, and visualization, we identify key predictors of survival and evaluate their impact.

## Project Overview
The Titanic disaster is one of the most studied historical events. By analyzing data on passenger class, age, gender, and fares, this project aims to:
- Identify significant predictors of survival.
- Build a logistic regression model to predict survival probabilities.
- Visualize and interpret the results.

## Key Findings
1. **Passenger Class (Pclass)**:
   - First-class passengers had significantly higher survival rates due to better access to lifeboats.
   - Third-class passengers faced more challenges in escaping the disaster.

2. **Age**:
   - Younger passengers were more likely to survive, likely due to rescue priorities.
   - Older passengers had a lower chance of survival.

3. **Fare**:
   - Higher fares were associated with better survival odds, reflecting advantages of higher social class.

4. **Model Performance**:
   - The logistic regression model demonstrated good performance with an AUC of 0.787.
   - The model effectively separated survivors and non-survivors, although some misclassifications were observed.

5. **Dataset**
Kaggle Titanic Dataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset
The dataset includes passenger details such as class, age, gender, and fare, which were used for analysis.
